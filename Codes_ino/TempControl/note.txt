Temperature control notes:

In this folder, there are .ino codes that will be used to control the
temperature inside the control box. The temperature is measure using an
one-wire bus of DS18B20 sensors and the code is optimized in order to use
only OneWire library, and there's no need to use the DallasTemperature
library. The first version uses serial monitor to display the values that are
measured by the sensors. The second version is up to go, without serial monitor,
and is lighter than the first one.
